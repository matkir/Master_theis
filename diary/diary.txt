[2018-03-15 15:45:31]: Been working on autoencoder, naive.
                       
                       Not getting any results lower than 0.09
                       
                       Need to experiment with debth, leyers and activationfunctuons.
                       
                       The plan is to use VAE after this goes well. Probably start on that next week.
                       
                       
                       GAN need a sorted libary later.
[2018-03-22 15:34:30]: working on modules and sphix
                       
                       
                       rn modules are working, only one EncDec, which is supposed to be shared all over the programs, since the networks should have the same structure.
                       
                       install.sh now downloads kvasir, and adds int. this means that the program when finished can be run anywhere.
                       
                       %TODO sphinx sucks, might have to find simon.
                       
                       
                       I still have to look at VAE, but first the goal is to make an autoencoder that works.
                       
                       Gans has to wait untill AE works
[2018-03-23 16:18:23]: Im finished with the first AE and GAN
                       Both the GAN and AE are simple, and they need to be upgraded a bit.
                       
                       Plot, load , encoder, decoder ,discriminator is all now a package. you can pip install it.
                       
                       Bug: GAN makes black images, need to find out why.
                       
                       TODO: finish GAN, Make AE more accurate. Combine the weights from GAN and AE
                       look in to VAE and that thing that combines AE and GAN.

[2018-04-03 15:25:49]: made a naive sorter to sort images based on green saqare.
                       
                       started on ccgan
                       
                       
[2018-04-05 17:16:56]: started a long run on gan, suspect good ish results
                       
                       Fixed install.sh, now properly does everything
                       Readme is better
                       
                       Sent mail about using AE in gan, suspect failiure.
[2018-04-09 14:20:28]: started on VAE, needs to connect the layers
                       
                       Watched VAE
                       
                       started 52 hr long simulation
                       
                       goodbye
[2018-04-17 17:59:28]: begynte på selector.
                       begynte på ccgan
                       
                       skal fokusere på framework først, så treningen på et senere tidspunkt.

[2018-04-20 14:38:44]: written on the thesis.. general setup is in the works. need more statistics and crap, ill find someone to help me.
                       
                       No coding today
[2018-04-23 16:48:23]: ccgan is done with mnsit
                       
                       Started work on contextencoder
                       
[2018-04-25 12:32:53]: remember O(n) in thesis
