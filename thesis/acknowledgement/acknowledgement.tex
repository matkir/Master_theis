First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors; Michael Riegler, PÃ¥l Halvorsen. They have given me the help and motivation I needed throughout my thesis.

I would also like to thank the two PhD students; Steven Hicks and Rune Borgli. Without their help and support, I would not have finished this thesis.

I would like to thank my family for the support I've gotten both before and during this thesis, and especially my parents Rune and Heidi for supporting my curiosity for all my living years. 

I big thank you goes out to Realistforeningen, as they have been like a second home for my last five years as a student.

Finally, I would like to thank my partner Jorun Ramstad. I would not have finished this thesis without the support and thoughtfulness she provided.
