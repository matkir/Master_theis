First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors; Michael Riegler, PÃ¥l Halvorsen. They have given me both help and motivation during my thesis.

I would also like to thank the two PhD students; Steven Hicks and Rune Borgli. Their guidance has been my primary way of staying on the right path during this thesis. 

I would like to thank my family for the support I've gotten during this thesis, and especially my parents Rune and Heidi for supporting my curiosity for all my living years. 

I big thank you goes out to Realistforeningen, as they have been like a second home for my last five years as a student.

Finally, I would like to thank my partner Jorun Ramstad. I could not have finished this thesis without the support and thoughtfulness she has provided during it all.
