\section{In painting}
  We have discussed the importance of good input data, and the potential benefits to resource usage and ease of making a good model.
  So a priority when it comes to image classification is to have data without anomalies and other areas that can be interpreted as a feature for the classifier. 
  In a machine learning perspective, the data is best if it has the same structure, and is %TODO similar enough.
  In painting is the process of reconstructing lost or deteriorated parts of images and videos. %TODO CITE https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inpainting
  

  From prior papers on polyp detection in the GI tract %TODO CITE!!!
  we have clear results that the black corners, and the green squares trigger a big activation %TODO WRITE BETTER
  when it comes to classifying images. 
  From %TODO CITE, find out who
  's paper, we can see that the activation map on a regular image gives very high result on, in addition to the polyp, the corners and the green sqare. 
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{background/figures/placeholder.jpeg}
    \caption{Using X's activation map we can see that the edges triggers unwanted activations}
  \end{figure}
  
  In addition to sqares and edges, we also have the problem that parts of the image is over saturated at points where the light from the led is reflected directly back to the camera.
  Another problem is when the camera captures images that are too close to the wall. Both of these scenarios creates patches where the saturation is maximum. 
   \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{background/figures/reflection.jpg}
    \caption{we have two different types of saturation: the reflected area in the top part of the image, and the right side of the image.}
  \end{figure}
  in an ideal scenario the image would have no pixel values at max, and as little frame as possible. 
  We therefor want to make a tool that can help us with this.
  \subsection{Naive methods for In painting}
    Inpainting is not a new area of research, as it has been around since %TODO CITE
    Because of this there are many naive methods that gives good inpaintings.

\section{Naive Methods REM}
	  Now that we have an idea of what we are looking for we can first turn to some more naive methods for detecting anomalies, and for enhancing the images.\\
	  The field of image processing has been researched since\\ %TODO WHEN
	  
	  Using some of the classic methods in image processing we can see if\\ %TODO
	  
	  We often describe the method in to two groups of information: First and Second order statistics.\\
	  \textbf{First order:} First order statistics does not take in to account the relative positioning of the pixels in the image, and because of this, gives much less
	  information than the second order statistics.\\
	  Example of First order statistics is often what information we can get out of a histogram. This can be scewness, variance, and mean value.\\
	  
	  \vspace{10px}
	  
	  \textbf{Second order:} Second order statistics takes in to account the relative positioning of the pixels in the image. We can calculate the GLCM matrix and get a much more detailed 
	  view of the image. \\
	  
	  
	  
	  \subsection{GLCM}
	    A GLCM (Grey-level co-occurrence matrix) is a matrix that is used when examining the spatial relationship of pixels in a texture. 
	    The calculation of a GLCM gives us how often pairs of pixels with spesific values and a specified spatial relationship occur at a given place in an image. %TODO CITE
	  
	    \subsubsection{Algorithm}
	      For simplicity we use only greyscale in this example:
	      \begin{figure}[ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/sliding_window_box.png}
		\caption{GLCM capturing features}
	      \end{figure}
	      The algorithm starts by running a sliding window over the image, often with a stride, and for each stops calculates the spatial relationship between each pixel specified.
	      The result can be something like this figure %TODO link to figure
	      where we can read out the most likely neighbouring pixel.
	       \begin{figure}[ht]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/Simple_GLCM.png}
		\caption{GLCM Matrix}
	      \end{figure}
	      The darker colours on in the matrix is indicating that we often have a jump between, for instance pixel-value of 1 and a pixel-value of 4, but no from 1 to 1.\\
	      With this information we can get a naive pattern-recogniser. 
	    \subsubsection{Other uses}
	      Besides for the pattern recognition we can use the GLCM to get the information on:
	      \begin{itemize}
	       \item \textbf{Contrast} is the difference in luminance or colour in the picture. We would expect low contrast in the “background” and higher contrast around edges and irregular objects.
	       \item \textbf{Homogeneity} is how similar a local area is to itself
	       \item \textbf{Variance} $\sigma^2$ , is directly a measure of ”roughness”
	       \item \textbf{Mean} value of a GLCM can give us areas with higer or lower pixel values. Good way to find polyps if they are lighter than the tissue around.
	       \item \textbf{Entropy}
	       \item \textbf{Energy}
	      \end{itemize}


	  
	  \subsection{Edge detection}
	    Using Edge detection in is another viable way to look for polyps. 
	    \begin{figure}[ht]
	      \centering
	      \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/sliding_window.png}
		\caption{Original image}
	      \end{minipage}
	      \hfill
	      \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Canny.png}
		\caption{Edges of the picture}
	      \end{minipage}
	    \end{figure}
	    \subsubsection{Algorithm}
	      For each pixel look at the neighbouring pixel, if \\
	      
	      \begin{centering} 
		$ abs(p_a - p_b)>tresh $\\ 
	      \end{centering}
	      
	      then mark pixel as an edge pixel. \\
	      
	  \subsection{Hough Transforms}
	    Using for instance Canny edge detection %TODO CITE
	    we can get a better view of where the potential border of the polyp/anomaly is. (As shown in %TODO FIG CITE)
	    
	    A hough transform can i theory have many/any shape(s), and together with edge detection, we might find some of the polyps this way.
	    
    
    
    
    
    
	
    As we can see from this, there are a lot of old methods that can give approximations. We can also conclude that none of these methods are perfect.
    We will therefore look at methods that takes learning in to use.
\section{Using machine learning for inpainting}
    \subsection{AE}
    \subsection{CE}
    \subsection{CCGAN}
    \subsection{PCNN}
    As discussed earlier, machine learning is using prior experiences to make decisions given the problem at hand. 
    It is also worth mentioning that we do not need labeled data, since we are in a way looking at a global average of every image both with, and without polyps. We are therefor incentiviced to use an 
    Unsupervised approach.
    Since machine learning is learning from a training set, it is important that the training set contains as little as possible of the features we want to remove. \\
    
    Because of this the first thing we need to do if we are going to mask out corners and sqares, is to limit the training set to only contain cropped, non-sqare images. 
 
    \begin{figure}[ht]
      \centering
      \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{background/figures/uncropped_img.png}
	\caption{Original image with black padding}

      \hfill
      \begin{minipage}[b]{0.45\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{background/figures/cropped_8percent_img.png}
	\caption{Black edges cropped away + 8\% zoom}
      \end{minipage}
      \caption{Here we have an example on how we would make an image better to train on. This is not representative of the training, since we only use images without the green square under training}
    \end{figure}
    
    Now that we have better images to train our data with, we need the correct algorithm.
    We have already seen unsupervised learning aproaches in chapter %TODO ref

	\newpage
	As we recall from earlier, an autoencoder is a type of neural network that tries to output a recreation of the output.\\%TODO: REF the part about autoencoders 
	We can use this for inpainting by setting the algorithm to train on images with areas cropped away.
	There are a couple of different way we can train an autoencoder to do this.\\
	
	%\todo{should i talk about the different ways or present the best?}
	
	
	\vspace{10px}
	\textbf{Denoising Autoencoder with MSE loss:}\label{par:Denoising_Autoencoder_with_MSE_loss}\\
	The simplest way to train the autoencoder is to first take the trainingset $\mathds{X}$ and make an augmented copy $\widetilde{\textbf{x}}^{(i)}$ for 
	every data point in $\textbf{x}_{\sim \mathds{X}}^{(i)}$. \\
	\textit{Here $\widetilde{\textbf{x}}$ is a copy of x with random areas masked.}\\
	
	Now we minimize the loss function\\	
	  \begin{equation}
	    L(\textbf{x},g(f(\widetilde{\textbf{x}})))
	  \end{equation}
	over the whole image.\\
	\vspace{20px}
	
	With this approach the autoencoder learns to fill in the blank spots with plausible data, without changing the rest of the image. 
	\todo{this will probably work best if the autoencoder is not undercomplete, perhaps talk about this}
	One problem by this approach is that we do not want the rest of the image to change for obvious reasons, and the alogrithm as it is here has the flaw that it will change all the pixels in the image, at 
	least to a minor degree. \\
	
	This can be somewhat fixed by only taking the augmented parts, and pasting the directly in to the image. This will leave most of the original image, except for the parts that was cropped randomly.\\
	
	\vspace{10px}
	\textbf{Denoising Autoencoder with \todo{clever tittle}:}\\
	If we take what we learned from \ref{par:Denoising_Autoencoder_with_MSE_loss}, we can make a more optimal autoencoder:
	Rather than taking a loss like 	
	\begin{equation}
	  L(\textbf{x},g(f(\widetilde{\textbf{x}})))
	\end{equation}
	over the whole image, we can rather just focus on the parts that matters, namely the cropped areas.\\
	
	If we add the cropped image to the output from the autoencoder to make an image image, we can use this new image to train out loss.
	For most of the image, the loss will be zero, since the only part that is changed is the cropped area. 
	We can also make a new loss that is more optimal for the task at hand. 
	\begin{equation}
	  MSE_{crop}\:=\: \frac{1}{n}
	  \begin{cases}
	      \begin{array}{lcl}
	      (\widetilde{\textbf{x}}-\textbf{x}) \; if \; \widetilde{\textbf{x}} \: \in \: \textbf{x}_{crop} \\
	      0 \; else
	      \end{array}
	  \end{cases}
	\end{equation}
	Where $\textbf{x}_{crop}$ is the area that was cropped away from the original image and $n$ is the number of pixels in that area.\\
	With this modified MSE we are assured that only the pixels in the cropped area is changed with gradient decent, and we save a lot of computation as an added bonus.

      \subsubsection{Contextencoder}
	Inpainting can also be done with advaserial models, and using a network trained to do the task of inpainting can be a lot more powerful than using just an autoencoder\todo{ref} or the naive methods\todo{ref}.
	A contextencoder is building on the advaserial principle by using a generator/discriminator pair to fill in masked areas in an image. 
	
	The concept behind a Contextencoder is to take the whole image as input to an encoder/decoder pair and \todo{finish}
