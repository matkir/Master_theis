abstract = "Predictions of the secondary structure of T4 phage lysozyme, made by a number of investigators on the basis of the amino acid sequence, are compared with the structure of the protein determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography. Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both β-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140–142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations."

In addition to optimizing the Keras classifier configuration, we try manipulating the dataset by adding extra images in a class lacking in images and splitting a commonly misclassified class into two classes.},

abstract="A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by ``learning without a teacher'', and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname ``neocognitron''. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of ``S-cells'', which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of ``C-cells'' similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any ``teacher'' during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.",

ABSTRACT = {Despite recent advances of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in various computer vision tasks, their potential for classification of multispectral remote sensing images has not been thoroughly explored. In particular, the applications of deep CNNs using optical remote sensing data have focused on the classification of very high-resolution aerial and satellite data, owing to the similarity of these data to the large datasets in computer vision. Accordingly, this study presents a detailed investigation of state-of-the-art deep learning tools for classification of complex wetland classes using multispectral RapidEye optical imagery. Specifically, we examine the capacity of seven well-known deep convnets, namely DenseNet121, InceptionV3, VGG16, VGG19, Xception, ResNet50, and InceptionResNetV2, for wetland mapping in Canada. In addition, the classification results obtained from deep CNNs are compared with those based on conventional machine learning tools, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machine, to further evaluate the efficiency of the former to classify wetlands. The results illustrate that the full-training of convnets using five spectral bands outperforms the other strategies for all convnets. InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, and Xception are distinguished as the top three convnets, providing state-of-the-art classification accuracies of 96.17%, 94.81%, and 93.57%, respectively. The classification accuracies obtained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) are 74.89% and 76.08%, respectively, considerably inferior relative to CNNs. Importantly, InceptionResNetV2 is consistently found to be superior compared to all other convnets, suggesting the integration of Inception and ResNet modules is an efficient architecture for classifying complex remote sensing scenes such as wetlands.},

ABSTRACT="Automated disease detection in videos and images from the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract has received much attention in the last years. However, the
quality of image data is often reduced due to overlays of text and
positional data. In this paper, we present different methods of
preprocessing such images and we describe our approach to GI disease
classification for the Kvasir v2 dataset. We propose multiple approaches to
inpaint problematic areas in the images to improve the anomaly
classification, and we discuss the effect that such preprocessing does to
the input data. In short, our experiments show that the proposed methods
improve the Matthews correlation coefficient by approximately 7\\% in terms
of better classification of GI anomalies."

abstract="Analysis of medical videos from the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract for detection and localization of abnormalities like lesions and diseases requires both high precision and recall. Additionally, it is important to support efficient, real-time processing for live feedback during (i) standard colonoscopies and (ii) scalability for massive population-based screening, which we conjecture can be done using a wireless video capsule endoscope (camera-pill). Existing related work in this field does neither provide the necessary combination of accuracy and performance for detecting multiple classes of abnormalities simultaneously nor for particular disease localization tasks. In this paper, a complete end-to-end multimedia system is presented where the aim is to tackle automatic analysis of GI tract videos. The system includes an entire pipeline ranging from data collection, processing and analysis, to visualization. The system combines deep learning neural networks, information retrieval, and analysis of global and local image features in order to implement multi-class classification, detection and localization. Furthermore, it is built in a modular way, so that it can be easily extended to deal with other types of abnormalities. Simultaneously, the system is developed for efficient processing in order to provide real-time feedback to the doctors and for scalability reasons when potentially applied for massive population-based algorithmic screenings in the future. Initial experiments show that our system has multi-class detection accuracy and polyp localization precision at least as good as state-of-the-art systems, and provides additional novelty in terms of real-time performance, low resource consumption and ability to extend with support for new classes of diseases.",
