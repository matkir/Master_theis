@article{2008Kim,
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Important lesions related to
                  gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are located
                  around the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). This
                  study examined the distribution of endoscopic
                  findings around the GEJ and elucidated their
                  relationship to each other and esophageal manometric
                  features. METHODS: Endoscopic data were collected
                  prospectively from 2,450 consecutive diagnostic
                  upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. The presence and
                  degree of hiatal hernia (HH), columnar-lined
                  esophagus (CLE), and reflux esophagitis (RE) were
                  recorded. Esophageal manometric data were collected
                  from 181 patients. RESULTS: The prevalence of HH,
                  CLE, and RE was 9.8, 18.8, and 9.9{\%},
                  respectively. Of all HH and CLE cases, 62.8 and
                  98.9{\%}, respectively, were of the short-segment
                  variety. Of all RE cases, 95.0{\%} were
                  mild. Younger age, male gender, the presence of HH,
                  and a higher gastroesophageal flap valve (GEFV)
                  grades were associated with the presence of
                  RE. Increased ZAP grades were associated with
                  increased prevalence and grades of HH, CLE, and
                  RE. Higher GEFV grades were associated with
                  increased prevalence and grades of HH, CLE, and
                  RE. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP)
                  decreased in patients with HH or RE compared to
                  those without HH or RE. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic
                  findings around the GEJ revealed that a substantial
                  proportion of our patients showed features
                  potentially related to GERD. In combination with
                  other recent reports, our study implies that Korea
                  is no longer a very-low-prevalence area of GERD,
                  although it may predominate in silent or milder
                  forms. },

@article{2017Kim,
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Colonoscopic polypectomy is the
                  best diagnostic and therapeutic tool to detect and
                  prevent colorectal neoplasms. However, previous
                  studies have reported that 17{\%} to 28{\%} of
                  colorectal polyps are missed during colonoscopy. We
                  investigated the miss rate of neoplastic polyps and
                  the factors associated with missed polyps from
                  quality-adjusted consecutive colonoscopies. METHODS:
                  We reviewed the medical records of patients who were
                  found to have colorectal polyps at a medical
                  examination center of the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital
                  between March 2012 and February 2013. Patients who
                  were referred to a single tertiary academic medical
                  center and underwent colonoscopic polypectomy on the
                  same day were enrolled in our study. The odds ratios
                  (ORs) associated with polyp-related and
                  patient-related factors were evaluated using
                  logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of
                  463 patients and 1,294 neoplastic polyps were
                  analyzed. The miss rates for adenomas, advanced
                  adenomas, and carcinomas were 24.1{\%} (312/1,294),
                  1.2{\%} (15/1,294), and 0{\%} (0/1,294),
                  respectively. Flat/sessile-shaped adenomas (adjusted
                  OR, 3.62; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI],
                  2.40–5.46) and smaller adenomas (adjusted OR, 5.63;
                  95{\%} CI, 2.84– 11.15 for ≤5 mm; adjusted OR, 3.18;
                  95{\%} CI, 1.60–6.30 for 6–9 mm, respectively) were
                  more frequently missed than
                  pedunculated/sub-pedunculated adenomas and larger
                  adenomas. In patients with 2 or more polyps compared
                  with only one detected (adjusted OR, 2.37; 95{\%}
                  CI, 1.55–3.61 for 2–4 polyps; adjusted OR, 11.52;
                  95{\%} CI, 4.61–28.79 for ≥5 polyps, respectively)
                  during the first endoscopy, the risk of missing an
                  additional polyp was significantly
                  higher. CONCLUSIONS: One-quarter of neoplastic
                  polyps was missed during colonoscopy. We encourage
                  endoscopists to detect smaller and flat or sessile
                  polyps by using the optimal withdrawal technique. },

                  recognizing simple objects with high shape
                  variability such as handwritten characters, it is
                  possible, and even advantageous, to feed the system

                  on learning to extract the right set of
                  features. Convolutional Neural Networks are shown to
                  be particularly well suited to this task. We also

  abstract =	 {Learning visual models of object categories
                  notoriously requires hundreds or thousands of
                  training examples. We show that it is possible to
                  learn much information about a category from just
                  one, or a handful, of images. The key insight is
                  that, rather than learning from scratch, one can
                  take advantage of knowledge coming from previously
                  learned categories, no matter how different these
                  categories might be. We explore a Bayesian
                  implementation of this idea. Object categories are
                  represented by probabilistic models. Prior knowledge
                  is represented as a probability density function on
                  the parameters of these models. The posterior model
                  for an object category is obtained by updating the
                  prior in the light of one or more observations. We
                  test a simple implementation of our algorithm on a
                  database of 101 diverse object categories. We
                  compare category models learned by an implementation
                  of our Bayesian approach to models learned from by
                  maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum a posteriori
                  (MAP) methods. We find that on a database of more
                  than 100 categories, the Bayesian approach produces
                  informative models when the number of training
                  examples is too small for other methods to operate
                  successfully.},

                  has given gastroenterologists the opportunity to
                  investigate the small bowel in a non-invasive
                  way. CE is most commonly performed for obscure
                  gastrointestinal bleeding, but other indications
                  include diagnosis or follow-up of Crohn's disease,
                  suspicion of a small bowel tumor, diagnosis and
                  surveillance of hereditary polyposis syndromes,
                  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced small
                  bowel lesions and celiac disease. Almost fifteen
                  years have passed since the release of the small
                  bowel capsule. The purpose of this review is to
                  offer the reader a brief but complete overview on
                  small bowel CE anno 2014, including the technical
                  and procedural aspects, the possible complications
                  and the most important indications. We will end with
                  some future perspectives of CE. },

                  localization of abnormalities like lesions and
                  diseases requires both high precision and
                  recall. Additionally, it is important to support
                  efficient, real-time processing for live feedback
                  during (i) standard colonoscopies and (ii)
                  scalability for massive population-based screening,
                  which we conjecture can be done using a wireless
                  video capsule endoscope (camera-pill). Existing
                  related work in this field does neither provide the
                  necessary combination of accuracy and performance
                  for detecting multiple classes of abnormalities

                  localization tasks. In this paper, a complete
                  end-to-end multimedia system is presented where the
                  aim is to tackle automatic analysis of GI tract
                  videos. The system includes an entire pipeline
                  ranging from data collection, processing and
                  analysis, to visualization. The system combines deep
                  learning neural networks, information retrieval, and
                  analysis of global and local image features in order
                  to implement multi-class classification, detection
                  and localization. Furthermore, it is built in a
                  modular way, so that it can be easily extended to
                  deal with other types of
                  abnormalities. Simultaneously, the system is
                  developed for efficient processing in order to
                  provide real-time feedback to the doctors and for
                  scalability reasons when potentially applied for
                  massive population-based algorithmic screenings in
                  the future. Initial experiments show that our system
                  has multi-class detection accuracy and polyp
                  localization precision at least as good as
                  state-of-the-art systems, and provides additional
                  novelty in terms of real-time performance, low

                  gastrointestinal tract directly, it has been widely
                  used for gastrointestinal examination. But it is
                  hard for clinicians to accurately detect
                  gastrointestinal disease due to its great dependence
                  on doctors experiences. Therefore, a computer-aided
                  lesion detection system can offer great help for
                  clinicians. In this paper, we propose a new scheme
                  for endoscopy image lesion detection. A trainable
                  feature extractor based on convolutional neural
                  network (CNN) is utilized to get more generic
                  features for endoscopy images. And features are fed
                  to support vector machine (SVM) to enhance the
                  generalization ability. Experiments show that the
                  proposed scheme outperforms the previous

                  non-invasive modality for small bowel
                  examination. Recently, the development of
                  computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for
                  gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding detection in WCE
                  image videos has become an active research area with
                  the goal of relieving the workload of
                  physicians. Existing methods based primarily on
                  handcrafted features usually give insufficient
                  accuracy for bleeding detection, due to their
                  limited capability of feature representation. In

                  detection strategy based on a deep convolutional
                  neural network and evaluate our method on an

                  technology and applications supported by deep
                  learning. Deep learning is a growing trend in
                  general data analysis and has been termed one of the
                  10 breakthrough technologies of 2013. Deep learning
                  is an improvement of artificial neural networks,
                  consisting of more layers that permit higher levels
                  of abstraction and improved predictions from
                  data. To date, it is emerging as the leading
                  machine-learning tool in the general imaging and
                  computer vision domains. In particular,
                  convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to
                  be powerful tools for a broad range of computer
                  vision tasks. Deep CNNs automatically learn
                  mid-level and high-level abstractions obtained from
                  raw data (e.g., images). Recent results indicate
                  that the generic descriptors extracted from CNNs are
                  extremely effective in object recognition and
                  localization in natural images. Medical image
                  analysis groups across the world are quickly
                  entering the field and applying CNNs and other deep

                  reports produced in the United States represents a
                  large repository of clinical data. However, reports
                  are highly variable in content and structure and
                  therefore cannot be used to create clinical
                  databases. The introduction of automated endoscopic
                  reporting systems should permit database creation
                  only if acceptable standards for the structure and
                  content of the report are developed. The structure
                  of an endoscopic report is the framework in which
                  the specific details of the endoscopy can be
                  recorded. The basic components can consist of the
                  following: Patient, Visit, Study, Result, Diagnosis,
                  and Recommendation. Precise definition of each of
                  these components requires consensus on what the
                  minimum included elements should be. Experience with
                  the Minimal Standard Terminology indicates that it
                  is possible to create a broadly acceptable lexicon
                  of descriptive endoscopic terms which can be
                  included as a Result. The systematic development of
                  the structure and content of endoscopic reports is
                  mandatory before it is possible to create large,

                  gastrointestinal endoscopy, the European Society of
                  Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) has established
                  the ESGE Quality Improvement Committee. A
                  prerequisite for quality assurance and improvement
                  for all gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures is
                  state-of-the-art integrated digital reporting
                  systems for standardized documentation of the
                  procedures. The current paper describes the ESGE's
                  viewpoints on requirements for high-quality
                  endoscopy reporting systems. The following
                  recommendations are issued: Endoscopy reporting
                  systems must be electronic. Endoscopy reporting
                  systems should be integrated into hospital patient
                  record systems. Endoscopy reporting systems should
                  include patient identifiers to facilitate data
                  linkage to other data sources. Endoscopy reporting
                  systems shall restrict the use of free text entry to
                  a minimum, and be based mainly on structured data
                  entry. Separate entry of data for quality or
                  research purposes is discouraged. Automatic data
                  transfer for quality and research purposes must be
                  facilitated. Double entry of data by the endoscopist
                  or associate personnel is discouraged. Available
                  data from outside sources (administrative or
                  medical) must be made available
                  automatically. Endoscopy reporting systems shall
                  enable the inclusion of information on
                  histopathology of detected lesions; patient's
                  satisfaction; adverse events; surveillance
                  recommendations. Endoscopy reporting systems must
                  facilitate easy data retrieval at any time in a
                  universally compatible format. Endoscopy reporting
                  systems must include data fields for key performance
                  indicators as defined by quality improvement
                  committees. Endoscopy reporting systems must
                  facilitate changes in indicators and data entry

                  has promulgated guidelines on quality assurance in
                  gastrointestinal endoscopy. Thorough documentation
                  of endoscopy reports and a peer review process were
                  strongly recommended. We evaluated 1408 dictated
                  endoscopy and colonoscopy reports for deficiency in
                  reference to the guidelines during three periods: 6
                  months before (group 1), 6 months after the
                  application of the guidelines (group 2), and 5
                  months of intensive peer review process (group
                  3). Deficiency was defined as lack of documentation
                  of at least 1 of the 10 parameters that should be
                  included in endoscopy reports according to the
                  guidelines. There was a significant decrease in
                  deficiency rates in groups 2 (91.6{\%}) and 3
                  (32.7{\%}) compared with group 1 (99.8{\%}) (p

                  confrontation of the endoscopists with their
                  deficiencies significantly reduced the use of
                  inappropriate indication for endoscopy (1.5{\%}/
                  group 3 vs. 5.2{\%}/group 1, p {\textless}
                  0.01). Adherence to the A/S/G/E guidelines on
                  quality assurance improved documentation, decreased
                  inappropriate use of endoscopy, and may thus improve

                  attributed to colorectal cancer (CRC) in

                  reduce mortality rates and, by extension, confer
                  public health benefits, colonoscopy – one of the

                  harm. Ensuring high-quality CRC screening involves
                  the systematic evaluation of services, process

                  published criteria from the Quality Assurance Task
                  Group of the National Colorectal Cancer
                  Roundtable. METHODS: Consecutive colonoscopy reports
                  of patients at average/high risk screening, or with
                  a prior colorectal neoplasia (CRN) by endoscopists
                  who perform 11 000 procedures yearly, using a
                  commercial computerized endoscopic report
                  generator. A separate institutional database
                  providing pathological results. Required
                  documentation included patient demographics,
                  history, procedure indications, technical
                  descriptions, colonoscopy findings, interventions,
                  unplanned events, follow-up plans, and pathology
                  results. Reports abstraction employed a standardized
                  glossary with 10{\%} independent data
                  validation. Sample size calculations determined the
                  number of reports needed. RESULTS: Two hundreds and
                  fifty patients (63.2 ± 10.5 years, female: 42.8{\%},
                  average risk: 38.5{\%}, personal/family history of
                  CRN: 43.3{\%}/20.2{\%}) were scoped in June 2009 by
                  8 gastroenterologists and 3 surgeons (mean practice:
                  17.1 ± 8.5 years). Procedural indication and
                  informed consent were always documented. 14{\%}
                  provided a previous colonoscopy date (past polyp
                  removal information in 25{\%}, but insufficient in
                  most to determine surveillance intervals
                  appropriateness). Most procedural indicators were
                  recorded (exam date: 98.4{\%}, medications:
                  99.2{\%}, difficulty level: 98.8{\%}, prep quality:
                  99.6{\%}). All reports noted extent of visualization
                  (cecum: 94.4{\%}, with landmarks noted in 78.8{\%} -
                  photodocumentation: 67.2{\%}). No procedural times
                  were recorded. One hundred and eleven had polyps
                  (44.4{\%}) with anatomic location noted in 99.1{\%},
                  size in 65.8{\%}, morphology in 62.2{\%}; removal
                  was by cold biopsy in 25.2{\%} (cold snare: 18{\%},
                  snare cautery: 31.5{\%}, unrecorded: 20.7{\%}),
                  84.7{\%} were retrieved. Adenomas were noted in
                  24.8{\%} (advanced adenomas: 7.6{\%}, cancer:
                  0.4{\%}) in this population with varying previous
                  colonic investigations. CONCLUSION: This audit
                  reveals lacking reported items, justifying
                  additional research to optimize quality of

@article{Palmer2010,
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Quality endoscopy reporting is essential
                  when community endoscopists perform colonoscopies
                  for veterans who cannot be scheduled at a Veterans
                  Health Administration (VA) facility. OBJECTIVE: To
                  examine the quality of colonoscopy reports received
                  from community practices and to determine factors
                  associated with more complete reporting, using
                  national documentation guidelines. DESIGN:
                  Cross-sectional analysis SETTING: Reports submitted
                  to the Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, North
                  Carolina, from 2007 to 2008. PATIENTS: Subjects who
                  underwent fee-basis colonoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME
                  MEASUREMENTS: Scores created by comparing community
                  reports to published documentation guidelines. Three
                  scores, one for each category of information:
                  Universal Elements (found on all endoscopy reports),
                  Indication Elements (specific to the procedure
                  indication), and Finding Elements (specific to exam
                  findings). RESULTS: For the 135 included reports,
                  the summary scores were Universal Elements 57.6{\%}
                  [95{\%} Confidence Interval (C.I.) 55{\%}-60{\%}],
                  Indication Elements 73.7{\%} (95{\%}
                  C.I. 69{\%}-78{\%}), and Finding Elements 75.8{\%}
                  (95{\%} C.I. 73{\%}-79{\%}). Examples of poor
                  reporting included patient history (20.7{\%}), last
                  colonoscopy date (18.0{\%}), average versus high
                  risk screening (32.0{\%}), withdrawal time
                  (5.9{\%}), and cecal landmark photographs
                  (45.2{\%}). Only the use of automated reporting
                  software was associated with more thorough
                  reporting. LIMITATIONS: Modest sample size, mostly
                  male participants, frequent pathological findings,
                  limited geography, and lack of complete reporting by
                  a minority of providers DISCUSSION: The overall
                  completeness of colonoscopy reports was low,
                  possibly reflecting a lack of knowledge of reporting
                  guidelines or a lack of agreement regarding
                  important colonoscopy reporting elements. Automated
                  endoscopy software may improve reporting compliance
                  but may not completely standardize reporting
                  quality. },

                  Colonoscopy Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) in
                  2007. We examined 110 colonoscopy reports from
                  2005-2006 through Maryland Colorectal Cancer
                  Screening Program. We evaluated 25 key data elements
                  recommended by CO-RADS, including procedure
                  indications, risk/comorbidity assessments, procedure
                  technical descriptions, colonoscopy findings,
                  specimen retrieval/pathology. Among 110 reports,
                  73{\%} documented the bowel preparation quality and
                  82{\%} documented specific cecal landmarks. For the
                  177 individual polyps identified, information on
                  size and morphology was documented for 87{\%} and
                  53{\%}, respectively. Colonoscopy reporting varied
                  considerately in the pre-CO-RADS period. The absence
                  of key data elements may impact the ability to make
                  recommendations for recall intervals. This paper

@article{2010Fyock,
  abstract =	 {Polypectomy of colonic polyps has been shown to
                  reduce the risk of colon cancer development and is
                  considered a fundamental skill for all endoscopists
                  who perform colonoscopy. A variety of polypectomy
                  techniques and devices are available, and their use
                  can vary greatly based on local availability and
                  preferences. In general, cold forceps and cold snare
                  have been the polypectomy methods of choice for
                  smaller polyps, and hot snare has been the method of
                  choice for larger polyps. The use of hot forceps has
                  mostly fallen out of favor. Polypectomy for
                  difficult to remove polyps may require the use of
                  special devices and advanced techniques and has
                  continued to evolve. As a result, the vast majority
                  of polyps today can be removed endoscopically. Since
                  electrocautery is frequently used for polypectomy,
                  endoscopists should be thoroughly familiar with the
                  basic principles of electrosurgery as it pertains to
                  polypectomy. Tattooing of a polypectomy site is an
                  important adjunct to polypectomy and can greatly
                  facilitate future surgery or endoscopic
                  surveillance. The two most common post-polypectomy
                  complications are bleeding and perforation. Their
                  incidence can be decreased with the use of
                  meticulous polypectomy techniques and the
                  application of some prophylactic maneuvers. This
                  review will examine the technique of polypectomy and
                  its complications from the perspective of the
                  practicing gastroenterologist. },

@article{2014Hale,
  abstract =	 {Capsule endoscopy (CE) has transformed investigation
                  of the small bowel providing a non-invasive, well
                  tolerated means of accurately visualising the distal
                  duodenum, jejunum and ileum. Since the introduction
                  of small bowel CE thirteen years ago a high volume
                  of literature on indications, diagnostic yields and
                  safety profile has been presented. Inclusion in
                  national and international guidelines has placed
                  small bowel capsule endoscopy at the forefront of
                  investigation into suspected diseases of the small
                  bowel. Most commonly, small bowel CE is used in
                  patients with suspected bleeding or to identify
                  evidence of active Crohn's disease (CD) (in patients
                  with or without a prior history of CD). Typically,
                  CE is undertaken after upper and lower
                  gastrointestinal flexible endoscopy has failed to
                  identify a diagnosis. Small bowel radiology or a
                  patency capsule test should be considered prior to
                  CE in those at high risk of strictures (such as
                  patients known to have CD or presenting with
                  obstructive symptoms) to reduce the risk of capsule
                  retention. CE also has a role in patients with
                  coeliac disease, suspected small bowel tumours and
                  other small bowel disorders. Since the advent of
                  small bowel CE, dedicated oesophageal and colon
                  capsule endoscopes have expanded the fields of
                  application to include the investigation of upper
                  and lower gastrointestinal disorders. Oesophageal CE
                  may be used to diagnose oesophagitis, Barrett's
                  oesophagus and varices but reliability in
                  identifying gastroduodenal pathology is unknown and
                  it does not have biopsy capability. Colon CE
                  provides an alternative to conventional colonoscopy
                  for symptomatic patients, while a possible role in
                  colorectal cancer screening is a fascinating
                  prospect. Current research is already addressing the
                  possibility of controlling capsule movement and
                  developing capsules which allow tissue sampling and
                  the administration of therapy. },

@article{2014Shussman,
  abstract =	 {A polyp is defined as any mass protruding into the
                  lumen of a hollow viscus. Colorectal polyps may be
                  classified by their macroscopic appearance as
                  sessile (flat, arising directly from the mucosal
                  layer) or pedunculated (extending from the mucosa
                  through a fibrovascular stalk). Colorectal polyps
                  may also be histologically classified as neoplastic
                  or as non-neoplastic (hyperplastic, hamartomatous,
                  or inflammatory). The neoplastic polyps are of
                  primary importance because they harbor a malignant
                  potential, which represents a stage in the
                  development of colorectal cancer. For this reason,
                  it is essential to identify these polyps at a
                  sufficiently early stage, when a simple outpatient
                  procedure to remove them can interrupt the
                  development of colorectal cancer and prevent disease
                  and death. When invasive carcinoma arises in a
                  polyp, careful consideration must be given to
                  ensuring the adequacy of treatment. Although most
                  neoplastic polyps do not evolve into cancer, it is
                  well accepted that the majority of colorectal
                  carcinomas evolve from adenomatous polyps; the
                  sequence of events leading to this transformation is
                  referred to as the adenoma-to-carcinoma
                  sequence. The presence of a systemic process that
                  promotes the development of multiple
                  gastro-intestinal polyps is termed
                  ‘polyposis'. Hereditary gastro-intestinal polyposis
                  syndromes account for approximately 1{\%} of all
                  cases of colorectal cancer and are associated with a
                  broad spectrum of extra-colonic tumors. Early
                  detection and accurate classification of these
                  syndromes are essential, in order to initiate a
                  surveillance program for the early detection of
                  cancer. Several polyposis syndromes have been
                  described, each having its own genetic basis and
                  characteristic polyp distribution, clinical
                  presentation, and malignancy risk. Diagnostic
                  modalities and treatment options for neoplastic
                  polyps—as well as the most prevalent polyposis
                  syndromes—are reviewed below. },

@article{Lundell1999,
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND—Endoscopic oesophageal changes are
                  diagnostically helpful and identify patients exposed
                  to the risk of disease chronicity. However, there is
                  a serious lack of agreement about how to describe
                  and classify the appearance of reflux
                  oesophagitis AIMS—To examine the reliability of
                  criteria that describe the circumferential extent of
                  mucosal breaks and to evaluate the functional and
                  clinical correlates of patients with reflux disease
                  whose oesophagitis was graded according to the Los
                  Angeles system. METHODS—Forty six endoscopists from
                  different countries used a detailed worksheet to
                  evaluate endoscopic video recordings from
                  22( )patients with the full range of severity of
                  reflux oesophagitis. In separate studies, Los
                  Angeles system gradings were correlated with 24 hour
                  oesophageal pH monitoring (178 patients), and with
                  clinical trials of omeprazole treatment
                  (277( )patients). RESULTS—Evaluation of
                  circumferential extent of oesophagitis by the
                  criterion of whether mucosal breaks extended between
                  the tops of mucosal folds, gave acceptable agreement
                  (mean $\kappa$ value 0.4) among observers. This
                  approach is used in the Los Angeles system. An
                  alternative approach of grouping the circumferential
                  extent of mucosal breaks as occupying 0-25{\%},
                  26-50{\%}, 51-75{\%}, 76-99{\%}, or 100{\%} of the
                  oesophageal circumference, gave unacceptably high
                  interobserver variation (mean $\kappa$ values
                  0-0.15) for all but the lowest category of extent
                  (mean $\kappa$ value 0.4). Severity of oesophageal
                  acid exposure was significantly (p{\textless}0.001)
                  related to the severity grade of
                  oesophagitis. Preteatment oesophagitis grades A-C
                  were related to heartburn severity
                  (p{\textless}0.01), outcomes of omeprazole (10 mg
                  daily) treatment (p{\textless}0.01), and the risk
                  for symptom relapse off therapy over six months
                  (p{\textless}0.05). CONCLUSIONS—Results add further
                  support to previous studies for the clinical utility
                  of the Los Angeles system for endoscopic grading of
                  oesophagitis.   Keywords: oesophagitis; endoscopy;

@article{Saino2015,
  abstract =	 {Background: As previously reported, the magnetic
                  sphincter augmentation device (MSAD) preserves
                  gastric anatomy and results in less severe side
                  effects than traditional antireflux surgery. The
                  final 5-year results of a pilot study are reported
                  here. Patients and Methods: A prospective,
                  multicenter study evaluated safety and efficacy of
                  the MSAD for 5 years. Prior to MSAD placement,
                  patients had abnormal esophageal acid and symptoms
                  poorly controlled by proton pump inhibitors
                  (PPIs). Patients served as their own control, which
                  allowed comparison between baseline and
                  postoperative measurements to determine individual
                  treatment effect. At 5 years, gastroesophageal
                  reflux disease (GERD)-Health Related Quality of Life
                  (HRQL) questionnaire score, esophageal pH, PPI use,
                  and complications were evaluated. Results: Between
                  February 2007 and October 2008, 44 patients (26
                  males) had an MSAD implanted by laparoscopy, and 33
                  patients were followed up at 5 years. Mean total
                  percentage of time with pH {\textless}4 was 11.9{\%}
                  at baseline and 4.6{\%} at 5 years
                  (P {\textless} .001), with 85{\%} of patients
                  achieving pH normalization or at least a 50{\%}
                  reduction. Mean total GERD-HRQL score improved
                  significantly from 25.7 to 2.9 (P {\textless} .001)
                  when comparing baseline and 5 years, and 93.9{\%} of
                  patients had at least a 50{\%} reduction in total
                  score compared with baseline. Complete
                  discontinuation of PPIs was achieved by 87.8{\%} of
                  patients. No complications occurred in the long
                  term, including no device erosions or migrations at
                  any point. Conclusions: Based on long-term reduction
                  in esophageal acid, symptom improvement, and no late
                  complications, this study shows the relative safety
                  and efficacy of magnetic sphincter augmentation for
                  GERD. },
