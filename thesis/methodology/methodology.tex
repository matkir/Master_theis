With our background in both machine learning and \todo{medical background} we can now look at how we want to solve the problems associated with setting up a system for medical diagnosis.

    
\section{Libraries}

In this chapter, we will discuss the foundation of our code, important external libraries, and the setup and execution of our project.  
We will first discuss the programming language in question, give insight into the reasoning behind it. Then we will look into the framework used for machine learning, and in detail how it implemented in our programming language. Lastly, we will look into the wrapper we use to get a greater level of abstraction over our code, together with custom wrapper functions that are used by our wrapper. 


\todo{why we used python}
    \subsection{python}
    When doing machine learning, the most popular languages, in no particular order, are: Python, Java, R, C++, and C \todo{cite}. Some of these languages, like C and C++, are chosen for their speed, which is often a significant factor in Machine learning. Other languages, like R, is chosen because of its integration into the scientific community long before machine learning became a trend. The last group, consisting of Java and Python has gained popularity because of its already big user base. Python is also the winner when it comes to machine learning because of, like R, its integration into the scientific community. 
    Right now Python is the leading language for machine learning. Driven by this, there is a lot of focus into making it faster, to compete with already fast languages, like the C family. 

    Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language created in 1991.   It is a language that does \todo{does}, and more. 

    

    \subsection{tensorflow}
    Arguably the biggest reason for the success of machine learning in python lies in Tensorflow.\todo{cite} Tensorflow is a machine learning package developed by Google in \todo{year} and has since then become the leading framework for machine learning worldwide \todo{cote}.  
    \todo{something about projects with python, and how may uses}

    Tensorflow is today a multi-language tool, but it had its origin in python. It is just in later years that other languages has gotten tensorflow support. 

    \todo{tensorflow is, tensorflow does}



    \subsection{keras}
    One of the least attractive things with tensorflow is its unnecessary complexity.  
    Chollet did stuff!
